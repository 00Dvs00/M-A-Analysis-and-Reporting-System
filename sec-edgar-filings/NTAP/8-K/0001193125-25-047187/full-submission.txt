The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company&#8217;s existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January&#160;22, 2021, as amended. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0&#160;billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $50.0&#160;million available for the issuance of letters of credit on the Company&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; behalf. The facility matures on March&#160;5, 2030, with an option for the Company to extend the maturity date for two additional <span style="white-space:nowrap">1-year</span> periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for its existing commercial paper program. As of March&#160;5, 2025, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Revolving loans accrue interest at a base rate or, at the Company&#8217;s option, an adjusted term SOFR rate (based on one, three or <span style="white-space:nowrap">six-month</span> interest periods) plus, in each case, a spread based on the ratings of the Company&#8217;s senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard&#160;&amp; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services. The spread ranges from 0% to 0.325% for base rate loans and 0.805% to 1.325% for adjusted term SOFR rate loans. The base rate means the highest of (a)&#160;the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (b)&#160;the highest of the federal funds or the overnight bank funding rate, in each case, plus a margin equal to 0.50% and (c)&#160;the adjusted term SOFR rate for a <span style="white-space:nowrap">1-month</span> interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%. Revolving loans may be borrowed in U.S. dollars or other agreed currencies. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to borrowings based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of borrowings based on the adjusted term SOFR rate (or at each three month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). The Company may borrow, prepay without premium or penalty, and reborrow revolving loans, subject to certain conditions. The principal amount of outstanding revolving loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on the maturity date. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with a maximum leverage ratio, measured quarterly. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, grant liens, sell all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, effect certain mergers and liquidate or dissolve, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The events of default under the Credit Agreement include payment defaults, material misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgments, certain ERISA events and change of control defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the termination of the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement, the acceleration of the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Credit Agreement and an increase in the rate of interest. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The facility provides for an expansion option that will allow the Company to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $500.0&#160;million, for a potential total commitment of $1.5&#160;billion. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and certain of their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or the Company&#8217;s affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. </p> <p style="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>
