<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Introduction </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a blank check company formed as a
Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the &#147;business combination&#148;). We have neither
engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a &#147;shell company&#148; as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) because we have no operations and
nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;17, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the &#147;initial public
offering&#148;) of 30,000,000 units (the &#147;units&#148;), including the issuance of 2,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters&#146; exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class&nbsp;A common
stock and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross
proceeds of $300,000,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the &#147;private
placement&#148;) of an aggregate of 4,000,000 warrants (the &#147;private placement warrants&#148;) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $2.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $8,000,000. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on September&nbsp;14, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares (the &#147;founder
shares&#148;) of our Class&nbsp;B common stock to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On November&nbsp;12, 2020, dMY effected a 1:1.1 stock split of the Class&nbsp;B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 7,906,250
founder shares outstanding. The initial stockholders agreed to forfeit up to 1,031,250 founder shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters in the initial public offering. The forfeiture would be
adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the founder shares would represent 20.0% of the common stock after the initial public offering. The underwriters partially exercised their
over-allotment option; thus, 406,250 founder shares were forfeited, resulting in an aggregate of 7,500,000 founder shares outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A total of
$300,000,000, comprised of $294,000,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $10,500,000 of the underwriters&#146; deferred discount) and $6,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants,
was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the &#147;trust account&#148;) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company, acting as trustee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2a-7</FONT> of the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii)&nbsp;the distribution of the trust account, as described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2020, there was $300,030,565 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for
franchise and income tax obligations of approximately $30,500 and $1,569,739 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December&nbsp;31, 2020, we have not withdrawn any of interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;7, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) with Ion Trap Acquisition Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of dMY (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;) and IonQ, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;IonQ&#148;), as disclosed in a Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> filed on March&nbsp;7, 2021. For

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial
business combination using cash held in the trust account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into),
shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be
financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment
of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to
identify, acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management team&#146;s established global relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic
investments globally and has done so successfully in a number of sectors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on November&nbsp;12, 2020, our &#147;amended and restated certificate of incorporation&#148;) prohibits us
from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New York Stock Exchange (the
&#147;NYSE&#148;) listing rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of
amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business
combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation
or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may
be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target&#146;s assets or prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or
acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of
the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a
target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than
a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such
business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be
based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may
encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to
us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated
with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately
completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor,
executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an
opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm stating that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock upon the completion of our
initial business combination at a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT> price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the
initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the
conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately $10.00 per public share as of December&nbsp;31, 2020. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT> amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem
their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The Sponsor, our officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock are voted in favor of the initial business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officer and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during
or after the initial public offering, in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a
stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any
public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we seek stockholder approval of our initial
business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may
purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from
making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-public</FONT> information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section&nbsp;13 and
Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purpose of any such purchases of shares
could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that
requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to
reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the
completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#147;float&#148; of our shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our
initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder
is acting in concert or as a &#147;group&#148; (as defined under Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering,
which we refer to as the &#147;Excess Shares.&#148; Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such
holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other
undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#146;s shares are not purchased by
us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#146; ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior
consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target
that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#146; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial
business combination. </P>

selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and
leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through
affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation
gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our
initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in

(iii)&nbsp;the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business

tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or make us unable to satisfy a minimum cash condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business

not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination
agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such
requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust
account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent
that the anti-dilution provision of the Class&nbsp;B common stock results in the issues of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock on a greater than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-to-one</FONT></FONT> basis upon
conversion of the shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed
in connection with an initial business combination. The per share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the
amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our
capital structure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase

negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will
increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other
parts of the world, including the United States. On January&nbsp;30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(COVID-19)</FONT> a &#147;Public Health Emergency of
International Concern.&#148; On January&nbsp;31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19,</FONT> and on March&nbsp;11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a &#147;pandemic.&#148; The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> outbreak has and a significant outbreak
of other infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination
could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> continues to restrict travel, limit the ability to have
meetings with potential investors or the target company&#146;s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity
of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> and the actions to contain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> or other
matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely
affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted
by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. </P>

open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such

transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could
be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number
of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our
initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section&nbsp;13 and Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#147;float&#148; of our Class&nbsp;A common stock or public warrants and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. </P>

applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, such stockholder
may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will
describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or submit public shares for redemption. For example, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are
record holders or hold their shares in &#147;street name,&#148; to, at the holder&#146;s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent, or to deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically prior to the date set
forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination is to be
held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business
days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its

initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a &#147;blank check&#148; company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000
and have filed a Current Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K,</FONT> including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as
Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business
combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if the initial public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in
the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Because of our limited resources and the
significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only
their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or
investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive
experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar or greater technical, human and other resources to ours or
more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net
proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This
inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our
initial business combination in conjunction with a stockholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us
at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that
are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If the net proceeds of the initial public offering not
being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least until November&nbsp;17, 2022, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business
combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of
the net proceeds of the initial public offering, only $1,000,000 were available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account are sufficient
to allow us to operate for at least until November&nbsp;17, 2022; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;no-shop&#148;</FONT> provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to
keep target businesses from &#147;shopping&#148; around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any
current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach
or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. </P>

other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share, or
possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds
held in the trust account could be reduced and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT> redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service
providers, prospective target businesses and other entities (except for our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including,
but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our
assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably
available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party&#146;s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriters of the initial public
offering as well as our registered independent public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose
particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust
account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business
combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">per-share</FONT>
redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement of which this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> forms a part, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or
products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below
the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii)&nbsp;the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the
trust assets, less taxes payable, <I>provided</I> that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not
such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to
reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor&#146;s only assets are securities of our company.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions
could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None
of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can
qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading
&#147;investment securities&#148; constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to
operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account
may only be invested in United States &#147;government securities&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2a-7</FONT> promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or
assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank
or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an &#147;investment company&#148; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The initial public offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in
government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i)&nbsp;the completion of our initial business combination; (ii)&nbsp;the redemption of any public
shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by November&nbsp;17, 2022; and (iii)&nbsp;absent an initial business combination by November&nbsp;17, 2022 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders&#146; rights or
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-initial</FONT> business combination activity, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as
discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not
allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are
available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with

those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our

Section&nbsp;280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">60-day</FONT> notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the

are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the
stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month from the closing of the initial public offering in the event

based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check
company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or
prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section&nbsp;281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of
the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially
brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by November&nbsp;17, 2022 is not considered a
liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then
pursuant to Section&nbsp;174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. </P>

in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus
we may not be in compliance with Section&nbsp;211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to
force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section&nbsp;211(c) of the DGCL. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Because we are

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our efforts to identify a prospective initial business combination target will not be limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic region. While we
may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management
team&#146;s established global relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic investments globally and has done so successfully in a number of sectors. Our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected
by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in
the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly
ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that
those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business
combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant
holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are
able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. </P>

transactions with available targets could become less favorable to us. Attractive transactions could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional

result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We may engage in a business combination with one or
more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated
with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and
directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination
with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a
business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or
appraisal firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders,
potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other
than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;14, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or
approximately $0.003 per share. On November&nbsp;12, 2020, we effected a 1:1.1 stock split of the founder shares, resulting in an aggregate of 7,906,250 founder shares outstanding of which 7,831,250 shares were held by our sponsor. The underwriters
partially exercised their over-allotment option; thus, 406,250 founder shares were forfeited, resulting in an aggregate of 7,500,000 founder shares outstanding of which 7,425,000 shares are held by our sponsor. Prior to the initial investment in the
company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The
founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,000,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable for one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock at $11.50
per share, subject to adjustment as described herein, for an aggregate purchase price of $8,000,000, or $2.00 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial business combination within the allocated time period. In
addition, we may obtain loans from our sponsor, affiliates of our sponsor or an officer or director. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business
combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">24-month</FONT> anniversary of
the closing of the initial public offering nears, which is the deadline for our completion of an initial business combination. </P>

filing with the SEC. Any such amendments would not require approval from our stockholders, may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an
investment in our securities. For example, amendments to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</FONT> provision discussed above may result in our initial stockholders selling their securities earlier than they would otherwise be permitted,
which may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemption by public
stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing
proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate.
Further, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, or to fund the purchase of other companies. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may
only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our
initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target
business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. </P>

involved in litigation relating to their business affairs. For example, on January&nbsp;12, 2021, dMY Technology Group, Inc. II, dMY Sponsor II, LLC, us and our Sponsor accepted service of a lawsuit where we are named as counterclaim defendants in
an underlying action by and between GTY Technology Holdings, Inc. (&#147;GTY&#148;), dMY Technology Group, Inc. and dMY Sponsor, LLC and Carter Glatt (&#147;Glatt&#148;) and Captains Neck Holdings LLC (&#147;Captains Neck&#148;), an entity of which
Mr.&nbsp;Glatt is a member. The underlying lawsuit, filed by dMY Technology Group, Inc. and dMY Sponsor, LLC, seeks a declaratory judgment that Glatt and Captains Neck are not entitled to membership units of dMY Sponsor LLC, which was formed by
Harry L. You, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-founder&nbsp;and</FONT> former President and Chief Financial Officer of GTY when Glatt was still working at GTY. The underlying lawsuit contains claims arising from Glatt&#146;s termination of
employment from GTY, including theft and misappropriation of confidential GTY information, breach of contract, breach of the duties of loyalty and fiduciary duty and conversion. Glatt has responded to the underlying lawsuit by asserting claims for
breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with business relations, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, and by adding Harry L. You, Niccolo de Masi, dMY Technology Group, Inc. II, dMY
Sponsor II, LLC us and our Sponsor as counterclaim defendants. Harry L. You and Niccolo de Masi, our Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer, respectively, served in corresponding roles for dMY Technology Group, Inc. and currently serve as Chairman

our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation. If our initial stockholders purchase any additional Class&nbsp;A common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither our initial stockholders nor, to our knowledge, any
of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> Factors that would be considered in making such
additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which
will generally serve for a terms for three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in
which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our &#147;staggered&#148; board of directors, only a minority of the board
of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least
until the completion of our initial business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may
lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal proxy rules
require that the proxy statement with respect to the vote on an initial business combination include historical and pro forma financial statement disclosure. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer
documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&#147;GAAP&#148;), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (&#147;IFRS&#148;), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#147;PCAOB&#148;). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be
unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2021. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to
comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the
independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly
burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its
internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. </P>

to structure our initial business combination in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-efficient</FONT> manner, tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial
and other considerations over tax considerations. For example, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to any requisite stockholder approval, we may structure our business combination in a manner that requires stockholders
and/or warrant holders to recognize gain or income for tax purposes, effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction, or reincorporate in a different jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction in which
the target company or business is located). We do not intend to make any cash distributions to stockholders or warrant holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, a stockholder or a warrant holder may
need to satisfy any liability resulting from our initial business combination with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion of the shares received. In addition, stockholders and warrant holders may also be subject to additional income,
withholding or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our initial business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may effect a business
combination with a target company that has business operations outside of the United States, and possibly, business operations in multiple jurisdictions. If we effect such a business combination, we could be subject to significant income,
withholding and other tax obligations in a number of jurisdictions with respect to income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of tax obligations and filings in other jurisdictions, we may have a
heightened risk related to audits or examinations by U.S. federal, state, local and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> taxing authorities. This additional complexity and risk could have an adverse effect on our <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or
other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material
issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not
later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">write-off</FONT> assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses.
Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of
this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to
partially finance the initial business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their
securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other
fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material
misstatement or material omission. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The role of an acquisition candidate&#146;s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although
we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate&#146;s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition
candidate will not wish to remain in place. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our management may not maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We
cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of
the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a
controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction
company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and
us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would
acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding
Class&nbsp;A common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&#146;s shares than we initially
acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not maintain control of the target business. </P>

satisfied by us only if (i)&nbsp;we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii)&nbsp;we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a

years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event of very low or negative yields, the amount of interest income (which we
may withdraw to pay income taxes, if any) would be reduced. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-rata</FONT> share of
the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income. If the balance of the trust account is reduced below $300,000,000 as a result of negative interest rates, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our

be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE&#146;s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE&#146;s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For
instance, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our global market capitalization would be required to be at least $150&nbsp;million, the aggregate market value of our publicly-held shares would be required to be
at least $40&nbsp;million and we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders and 1,100,000 publicly held shares. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. </P>

there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by
blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies
in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. </P>

pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a &#147;group&#148; of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 20% of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 20% of our Class&nbsp;A

without our prior consent, which we refer to as the &#147;Excess Shares.&#148; However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#146; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions.
Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 20% and, in order to dispose of
such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our initial stockholders paid an aggregate of

the initial public offering. Our initial stockholders acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon closing of the initial public offering, and assuming no value ascribed to the warrants included
in the units, the public stockholders incurred an immediate and substantial dilution of over 94%, the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share after the initial public offering and the initial offering price of $10.00 per
unit. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution&nbsp;provisions of the founder shares result in the issuance of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock on a greater than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-to-one&nbsp;basis</FONT></FONT> upon conversion of the founder shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek redemptions from the trust
for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution&nbsp;protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked&nbsp;securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to
our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a
cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>You may only be able to exercise your public warrants on a &#147;cashless basis&#148; under certain circumstances, and if you do so, you will receive fewer
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The warrant agreement provides that in the
following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section&nbsp;3(a)(9) of the Securities Act:
(i)&nbsp;if the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;if we have so elected and the shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of &#147;covered securities&#148; under Section&nbsp;18(b)(1) of the Securities Act. If you
exercise your public warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances described in clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;in the preceding sentence, you would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the &#147;fair market value&#148; of our shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The &#147;fair market value&#148; is the average reported closing price of the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would
receive fewer shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The grant of registration
rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our initial stockholders, the holders of our private placement warrants, the holders of warrants that may be issued upon
conversion of working capital loans and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock into which founder shares are convertible, the private placement warrants and the Class&nbsp;A common stock
issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants or the Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon conversion of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and any other securities of the company acquired by them prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect
on the market price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may
increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock that is expected when the shares of common stock owned by our initial
stockholders, holders of our private placement warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered. </P>

effectuate our initial business combination. </B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We issued warrants to purchase 7,500,000 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock as part of the units
sold in the initial public offering and, simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 4,000,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class&nbsp;A
common stock at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described herein. In addition, if our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors makes any working capital loans, such lender may convert those loans
into up to an additional 750,000 private placement warrants, at the price of $2.00 per warrant. To the extent we issue common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
and reduce the value of the Class&nbsp;A common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. </P>

entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar
to ours whose units include one common share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination
since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-fourth</FONT> of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more

comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem
important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock held by
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-affiliates</FONT> exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of any June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether
investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower
than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, Section&nbsp;102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-emerging</FONT> growth companies but any
such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an
emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. </P>

acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;). Our sponsor is dMY Sponsor III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our &#147;Sponsor&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our registration statement for our Initial Public Offering (the &#147;Initial Public Offering&#148;) became effective on November&nbsp;12,
2020.&nbsp;On&nbsp;November 17, 2020, we consummated the&nbsp;Initial Public Offering of&nbsp;30,000,000 units (&#147;Units&#148; and, with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock included in the Units being offered, the &#147;Public Shares&#148;),
including the 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters&#146; partial exercise of their over-allotment option (&#147;the Over-Allotment Units&#148;), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $300.0&nbsp;million, and incurring offering
costs of approximately $16.96&nbsp;million, inclusive of $10.50&nbsp;million in deferred underwriting commissions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Simultaneously with the closing of the
Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (&#147;Private Placement&#148;) of 4,000,000 warrants at a price of $2.00 per warrant (&#147;Private Placement Warrants&#148;) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of
$8.0&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement, and the over-allotment option,&nbsp;$300.0&nbsp;million
($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed&nbsp;in a trust account (&#147;Trust Account&#148;), located in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.
with Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. &#147;government securities&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185&nbsp;days or

financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value
of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following as its
critical accounting policies: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investments Held in the Trust Account </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof. Our investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities.
Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these investments are included in gain on marketable securities (net), dividends and
interest held in Trust Account in the statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for our Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480 &#147;Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.&#148; Shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Shares of conditionally redeemable Class&nbsp;A common stock
(including Class&nbsp;A common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity.
At all other times, shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock are classified as stockholders&#146; equity. Our Class&nbsp;A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of
uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of December&nbsp;31, 2020, 28,541,813 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&#146; equity section of our balance
sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Net Loss Per Common Share </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We comply with
accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, &#147;Earnings Per Share.&#148; Net income per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding for the period.&nbsp;We have not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of&nbsp;11,500,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.&nbsp;As a result, diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share for the period. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer (our &#147;Certifying Officers&#148;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.
Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all
instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of
disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, if any of the above executive officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination
opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to
such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a
company that is affiliated with the Sponsor, our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other
context. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, pursuant to the letter agreement, the
Sponsor, our officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares or private placement shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in
favor of our initial business combination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by
Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches
of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will enter into agreements with our officers and
directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also will permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or
employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance that insures our officers and
directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have
the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder&#146;s investment may be adversely
affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
believe that these provisions, the directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors. </P>

space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are utilized and we do not pay directly for such services. Upon completion
of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease making these payments. In addition, the Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, our officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind,
including finder&#146;s and consulting fees, will be paid to the Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination. </P>

adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the founder shares would represent 20.0% of the common stock after the initial public offering. The underwriters partially exercised their
over-allotment option; thus, 406,250 founder shares were forfeited, resulting in an aggregate of 7,500,000 founder shares outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Sponsor has

Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that
a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for
the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination or, at
the lender&#146;s discretion, up to $1.5&nbsp;million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $2.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement
Warrants. As of September&nbsp;30, 2020, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Administrative Services Agreement

conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;). The Company is an
emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of
December&nbsp;31, 2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from September&nbsp;14, 2020 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2020 relates to the Company&#146;s formation and the preparation of the initial public
offering (the &#147;Initial Public Offering&#148;) and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of
its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-operating</FONT> income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public
Offering. The Company has selected December&nbsp;31 as its fiscal year end. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s sponsor is dMY Sponsor III, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the &#147;Sponsor&#148;). The registration statement for the Company&#146;s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November&nbsp;12, 2020. On November&nbsp;17, 2020, the Company consummated its Initial
Public Offering of 30,000,000 units (&#147;Units&#148; and, with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock included in the Units being offered, the &#147;Public Shares&#148;), including the 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriters&#146;
partial exercise of their over-allotment option (&#147;the Over-Allotment Units&#148;), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $300.0&nbsp;million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $16.96&nbsp;million, inclusive of
$10.50&nbsp;million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 5). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the
Company consummated the private placement (&#147;Private Placement&#148;) of 4,000,000 warrants at a price of $2.00 per warrant (&#147;Private Placement Warrants&#148;) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $8.0&nbsp;million (Note 4). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $300.0&nbsp;million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the
Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (&#147;Trust Account&#148;) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company acting as trustee, and
invested only in United States &#147;government securities&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;) having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money

Company&#146;s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be
applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an
aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions) at the
time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. </P>

Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial

liquidity needs had been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account. To date, the Note remains outstanding. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a
Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company&#146;s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (see Note 4). To date, there were no amounts

Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for

30, 2020, the World Health Organization (&#147;WHO&#148;) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the &#147;COVID-19 outbreak&#148;). In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on
the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial position and cash flows will depend on future
developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related advisories and restrictions. These developments and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the financial markets and the overall economy are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are impacted for an extended period, the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, the Company&#146;s
ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be materially adversely affected due to significant governmental measures that have been, and may in the future be, implemented to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, including
travel restrictions, the shutdown of businesses and quarantines, among others, which may limit the Company&#146;s ability to have meetings with potential investors or affect the ability of a potential target company&#146;s personnel, vendors and
service providers to negotiate and consummate an initial Business Combination in a timely manner. The Company&#146;s ability to consummate an initial Business Combination may also be dependent on the ability to raise additional equity and debt

attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date.
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FASB ASC Topic

that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net
future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information
available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January 12, 2021, the Company, the Sponsor accepted service of a lawsuit where they are named as Counterclaim Defendants in an underlying
action by and between GTY Technology Holdings, Inc. (&#147;GTY&#148;), dMY Technology Holdings Inc., dMY Sponsor, LLC, dMY Sponsor II, LLC, dMY Technology Group Inc. II, the Company and the Sponsor (collectively &#147;dMY&#148;) and Carter Glatt
(&#147;Glatt&#148;) and Captains Neck Holdings LLC (&#147;Captains Neck&#148;). The Underlying Lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that Glatt and Captains Neck are not entitled to Class Y Units of dMY Sponsor LLC and contains claims arising from
Glatt&#146;s termination of employment from GTY on or about April 3, 2020 including theft and misappropriation of confidential GTY information, breach of contract, breach of the duties of loyalty and fiduciary duty and conversion. Glatt has, among
other things, responded to the Underlying Lawsuit by adding members of the Sponsor and officers of the Company as Counterclaim Defendants and adding Dune Acquisition Holdings LLC, a newly formed special purpose acquisition company as a
Counterclaimant and asserting claims for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with business relations, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. The Company has never employed Glatt and has
no business agreements with him. The Company has denied the claims against them and management intends to vigorously defend the Company. </P>
