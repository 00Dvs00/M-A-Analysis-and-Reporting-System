executed by each of the Parties; and any such waiver, amendment or supplement shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in
this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend, supplement or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement. </P>

privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. The rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise
have. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character of any breach or default under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision of this Agreement must satisfy the conditions set forth in

this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and

the prior sentence, the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
